        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make some sort of spooky bread for Halloween and came ukp with the idea of baking a calzone in the shape of a snake. I combined egg yolks with food coloring (and made several colors) and painted it to make a colorful striped snake. It was a hit with the kids! Recipe by: prttimecook</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package sliced pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced black olives (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 green bell pepper, cut into strips (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve sugar in warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Sprinkle yeast over water, and let stand for 5 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. Stir in oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour; mix on low until the mixture forms a wet dough. With the machine running, add 1 cup of flour, 1/4 cup at a time, and knead until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl into a ball. Knead for 3 to 5 more minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl; placed dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Combine ricotta, mozzarella, Parmeasan cheese, pepperoni, parsley, Italian seasoning, olives, green pepper, and mushrooms in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough; roll it out into a long, flat strip about 9 inches wide by 30 inches long. Spoon filling mixture down the center of dough strip, leaving about 1 inch on all sides for sealing. Pull edges of dough together; pinch to seal and form a long, filled. Place roll, seam-side down, onto the parchment paper in a snakey "S" shape, and tuck the ends underneath to seal. Beat egg in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of water; brush egg wash over calzone.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until calzone is golden brown. Let cool for 5 minutes before cutting into individual slices.</li>
        </ol>
